        The Blue Angel (German: Der blaue Engel) is a 1930 German tragicomedic film directed by Josef von Sternberg and
        starring Emil Jannings, Marlene Dietrich and Kurt Gerron. Written by Carl Zuckmayer, Karl Vollmöller and Robert
        Liebmann – with uncredited contributions by Sternberg – it is based on Heinrich Mann's 1905 novel Professor
        Unrat (Professor Garbage) and set in Weimar Germany. The Blue Angel presents the tragic transformation of a
        respectable professor to a cabaret clown and his descent into madness. The film is the first feature-length
        German full-talkie and brought Dietrich international fame.[2] In addition, it introduced her signature song,
        Friedrich Hollaender and Robert Liebmann's "Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)". It is considered to be a
        classic of German cinema.

        Film historian Andrew Sarris outlines Sternberg's "complex interplay" between Lola and the Professor:

        "The Blue Angel achieved its most electrifying effects through careful grading and construction. When Dietrich
        sings "Falling in Love Again" for the first time, the delivery is playful, flirtatious, and self-consciously
        seductive. The final rendition is harsher, colder, and remorseless. The difference in delivery is not related to
        the old sterotype of the seductress finally showing her true colors, but rather to a psychological development
        in Dietrich's Lola from mere sensual passivity to a more forceful fatalism about the nature of her desires.
        Lola's first instinct is to accept the Professor's paternal protection and her last is to affirm her natural
        instincts, not as coquettish expedients but as the very terms by which she expresses her existence. Thus, as the
        Professor has been defeated by Lola's beauty, Lola has been ennobled by the Professor's jealousy..."[40]

        Biographer John Baxter echoes this the key thematic sequence that reveals "the tragic dignity" of Rath's
        downfall:

        "[T]he tragedy of Immanuel Rath was not that he lost his head over a woman, but that he could not reconcile the
        loss of power with the acquisition of freedom." When Rath is forced to relinquish "his authority [over] his
        students, he sinks into alienated apathy…Rath's failure to grasp the chance opened to him…is portrayed in terms
        of his increasing silence, as he sinks more and more sullenly into the guise of the ridiculous, ironically named
        clown…In the end, the authoritarian master of language is bereft of articulate speech", finally erupting into a
        "paraoxysmic cockscrow" when he discovers that he has been cuckolded by Lola. [41]<br>
