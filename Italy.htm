        Bicycle Thieves is a 1948 Italian neorealist drama film directed by Vittorio De Sica. The film follows the story of a poor father searching post-World War II Rome for his stolen bicycle, without which he will lose the job which was to be the salvation of his young family. <br>

        Bicycle Thieves was part of what came to be called Italian Neorealism, a post-war movement where the glossy, polished studio productions of the past were replaced by gritty, authentic depictions of Italian life. Part of the aesthetic was to use non-actors, or at least actors who were very good at being natural. Director Vittorio De Sica wrote, "The man in the street, particularly if he is directed by someone who is himself an actor, is raw material that can be molded at will ... It is difficult—perhaps impossible—for a fully trained actor to forget his profession. It is far easier to teach it, to hand on just the little that is needed, just what will suffice for the purpose at hand."

        Every 10 years, the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound magazine conducts an international poll of directors, critics, and other film professionals to compile a list of the greatest movies of all time. It's considered one of the most prestigious (and, yes, elitist) lists in the industry. The first list, in 1952, had Bicycle Thieves at the top of it, followed by Charlie Chaplin's City Lights and The Gold Rush. Bicycle Thieves fell to seventh place in the 1962 poll, and subsequently disappeared from it altogether. But for a decade, it was the cream of the crop.

<h3>Italian Neorealism</h3>
<p>
        A movement born both of mood and resources, Neorealism emerged at a time when the former was one of disillusionment and the lack of the latter necessitated new levels of guile from its key players. Italy’s main film studio, Cinecittà, had been bombed by the Allies – presumably after watching a few of Mussolini’s fascist rom-coms – so directors like Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica took to the streets, using available lighting, non-professional actors and minimal equipment to capture stories of humble people scratching out a living in straits so dire you could put a headband on them and call them ‘Knopfler’.

        “Cinema is the most powerful weapon,” the fascists’ head of propaganda had asserted, but the Neorealists, some affluent (Visconti) and some born in poverty (De Sica), reforged it into a tool for social change by depicting the privations of Italian (and in Germany, Year Zero, German) society. Their struggling, blue-collar heroes and heroines weren’t played by glamorous movie stars but Bicycle Thieves’ Lamberto Maggiorani, a steelworker, and first-timer Antonio Arcidiacono in La Terra Trema. Writers like Cesare Zavattini and Umberto Barbaro penned scripts with heartache as a leitmotif.
