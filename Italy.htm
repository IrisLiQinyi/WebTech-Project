      Bicycle Thieves is a 1948 Italian neorealist drama film directed by
      Vittorio De Sica. The film follows the story of a poor father searching
      post-World War II Rome for his stolen bicycle, without which he will lose
      the job which was to be the salvation of his young family. It was part of
      what came to be called Italian Neorealism, a post-war movement where the
      glossy, polished studio productions of the past were replaced by gritty,
      authentic depictions of Italian life. Part of the aesthetic was to use
      non-actors, or at least actors who were very good at being natural. <br />

      Every 10 years, the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound magazine
      conducts an international poll of directors, critics, and other film
      professionals to compile a list of the greatest movies of all time. It's
      considered one of the most prestigious (and, yes, elitist) lists in the
      industry. The first list, in 1952, had Bicycle Thieves at the top of it,
      followed by Charlie Chaplin's City Lights and The Gold Rush. Bicycle
      Thieves fell to seventh place in the 1962 poll, and subsequently
      disappeared from it altogether. But for a decade, it was the cream of the crop.
      <br>
      A movement born both of mood and resources, Neorealism emerged at a time
      when the former was one of disillusionment and the lack of the latter
      necessitated new levels of guile from its key players. Italy’s main film
      studio, Cinecittà, had been bombed by the Allies – presumably after
      watching a few of Mussolini’s fascist rom-coms – so directors like Roberto
      Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica took to the streets, using available
      lighting, non-professional actors and minimal equipment to capture stories
      of humble people scratching out a living in straits so dire you could put
      a headband on them and call them ‘Knopfler’.
