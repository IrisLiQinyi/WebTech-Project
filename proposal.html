    <h2>Q1: What is your website about?</h2>
    <h3>This website provides introduction and analysis of classic global movies for movie lovers. Our movie list includes but not limited to "The blue angel", "Bicycle thief", "The 400 bowls" and "To live" .</h3>
    <h2>Q2: What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</h2>
    <h3>I will post some comments as well as professional prospectives spontaneously. This is a great platform for all movie lovers to share ideas and thoughts. Welcome! </h3>
    <h2>Q3: Who is your target audience set?</h2>
    <h3>All movie lovers are welcomed. No matter you are an avid movie fan or a amateur, I hope you can find some new movies that you like.  </h3>
    <h2>Q4: What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
    <h3>I will have a home page and a contact page. I will then develop other pages based on the country of the movie, with each page talking about the background of the movie, the idea in the movie and some analysis of the techniques used in the movie.</h3>
