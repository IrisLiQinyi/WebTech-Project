    <h3>French New Wave</h3>
    <p>To get a general idea of what this new cinematic approach meant, it might help to understand that before they were
    directors, the main players of the New Wave were the original film geeks or cinephiles. Cinema was very important in
    culture-starved post-war France, and most of the New Wave directors spent a great deal of time in their early years
    writing or thinking about it. Some were film critics, some were simply lovers of film - nearly all sharpened their
    cinematic sensibilities through long hours spent in the various Parisian cinematheques and film clubs. Their
    influences included everything from movies by realist Italian directors like Roberto Rosselini to hard-boiled Noir
    and B movies from America, as well as early silent classics and even the latest technicolour Hollywood musicals.
    From this passion for cinema they developed a belief in the theory of the auteur: that is, a conviction that the
    best films are the product of a personal artistic expression and should bear the stamp of personal authorship, much
    as great works of literature bear the stamp of the writer.</p>

    <p>
        Broadly speaking, the New Wave rejected the idea of a traditional story in the "Old Hollywood" sense of stories
        based on narrative styles and structures lifted from earlier media, namely books and theatre. The New Wave
        directors did not want to hold your hand through each scene, directing you emotion by emotion, through a fixed
        narrative. There was a feeling that this sort of storytelling interfered with the viewer's ability to perceive
        and react to film just as they would perceive and react to life. These directors wanted to break up the filmic
        experience, to make it fresh and exciting, and to jolt the moviegoer out of complacent viewing - to make the
        viewer think and feel, not only about what they were watching, but about their own lives, thoughts and emotions
        as well. Dialogue was to be as realistic and spontaneous as possible, or philosophical in a way that made one
        think beyond the film. Expressing the truth was of the utmost importance. The object was not simply to
        entertain, it was to sincerely communicate.

            The 400 Blows (French: Les Quatre Cents Coups) is a 1959 French New Wave drama film, and the directorial debut of François Truffaut. The film, shot in DyaliScope, stars Jean-Pierre Léaud, Albert Rémy, and Claire Maurier. One of the defining films of the French New Wave, it displays many of the characteristic traits of the movement. Written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussy, the film is about Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood adolescent in Paris who struggles with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious behavior. Filmed on location in Paris and Honfleur, it is the first in a series of five films in which Léaud plays the semi-autobiographical character.

            The 400 Blows received numerous awards and nominations, including the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, the OCIC Award, and a Palme d'Or nomination in 1959, and was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing in 1960. The film had 4.1 million admissions in France, making it Truffaut's most successful film in his home country.
            
            The 400 Blows is widely considered one of the best French films in the history of cinema; in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made, it was ranked 39th.
