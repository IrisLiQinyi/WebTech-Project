      To get a general idea of what this new cinematic approach meant, it might
      help to understand that before they were directors, the main players of
      the New Wave were the original film geeks or cinephiles. Cinema was very
      important in culture-starved post-war France, and most of the New Wave
      directors spent a great deal of time in their early years writing or
      thinking about it. Some were film critics, some were simply lovers of film
      - nearly all sharpened their cinematic sensibilities through long hours
      spent in the various Parisian cinematheques and film clubs. Their
      influences included everything from movies by realist Italian directors
      like Roberto Rosselini to hard-boiled Noir and B movies from America, as
      well as early silent classics and even the latest technicolour Hollywood
      musicals. From this passion for cinema they developed a belief in the
      theory of the auteur: that is, a conviction that the best films are the
      product of a personal artistic expression and should bear the stamp of
      personal authorship, much as great works of literature bear the stamp of
      the writer.

            Les Quatre Cents Coups is a 1959 French New Wave
            drama film, and the directorial debut of François Truffaut.
            One of the defining films of the French New Wave, it displays many of the
            characteristic traits of the movement. Written by Truffaut and Marcel
            Moussy, the film is about Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood adolescent in
            Paris who struggles with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious
            behavior. Filmed on location in Paris and Honfleur, it is the first in a
            series of five films in which Léaud plays the semi-autobiographical
            character. The 400 Blows received numerous awards and nominations,
            including the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, the OCIC
            Award, and a Palme d'Or nomination in 1959, and was also nominated for an
            Oscar for Best Writing in 1960. The film had 4.1 million admissions in
            France, making it Truffaut's most successful film in his home country. The
            400 Blows is widely considered one of the best French films in the history
            of cinema.
