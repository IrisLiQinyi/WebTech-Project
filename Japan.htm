      Ikiru is a 1952 Japanese drama film directed and co-written by Akira
      Kurosawa and starring Takashi Shimura. The film examines the struggles of
      a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. The
      screenplay was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novella The Death of
      Ivan Ilyich.

    />

    <div class="con1">
      The major themes of the film include learning how to live, the
      inefficiency of bureaucracy, and decaying family life in Japan, which have
      been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. The film has
      received widespread critical acclaim, and in Japan won awards for Best
      Film at the Kinema Junpo and Mainichi Film Awards. It was remade as a
      television film in 2007.
