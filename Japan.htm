    <p>Ikiru is a 1952 Japanese drama film directed and co-written by Akira Kurosawa and starring Takashi Shimura. The
        film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay
        was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich.</p><img src="image/ikiru2.jpg" height="300" alt="Ikiru" title="n">
