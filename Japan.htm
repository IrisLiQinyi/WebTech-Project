    <p>Ikiru is a 1952 Japanese drama film directed and co-written by Akira Kurosawa and starring Takashi Shimura. The
        film examines the struggles of a terminally ill Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. The screenplay
        was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich.</p><img src="image/ikiru2.jpg" height="300" alt="Ikiru" title="Inner Frame in the shot">

    <p>The major themes of the film include learning how to live, the inefficiency of bureaucracy, and decaying family life
    in Japan, which have been the subject of analysis by academics and critics. The film has received widespread
    critical acclaim, and in Japan won awards for Best Film at the Kinema Junpo and Mainichi Film Awards. It was remade
    as a television film in 2007.</p>
